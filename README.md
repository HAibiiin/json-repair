## What is json-repair?

**json-repair** is a Java library that provides repair for abnormal JSON generated by LLM (Large Language Model) at the application layer. Based on **json-repair**, the repair of abnormal JSON can be achieved simply, efficiently and accurately.

## Getting started

To get started with json-repair, first add it as a dependency in your Java project. If you're using Maven, that looks like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.haibiiin</groupId>
    <artifactId>json-repair</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>

```
If you're using Gradle, that looks like this:

```
implementation 'io.github.haibiiin:json-repair:0.1.0'
```
Next, You can instantiate a `JSONRepair` object  then call `handle()` function to repair JSON string like so.

```java
JSONRepair repair = new JSONRepair();
String correctJSON = repair.handle(mistakeJSON);
```

## Feature

You can learn about all the JSON exceptions that the current version 0.1.0 of **json-repair** supports for repair by checking the [test case dataset](https://github.com/HAibiiin/json-repair/blob/main/src/test/resources/case/simple.xml).

The functions based on the current version 0.1.0 are as follows:

* Implement the basic repair function for JSON strings:
  * Adding the missing right parenthesis;
  * Adding the missing right square bracket;
  * Cleaning up the redundant commas when the value is in the form of an array;
  * Filling in the missing values with "null".
